# The file system


1. Where do you start when you open RStudio?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

2. What happens if you use `setwd()` but specify a path to something that doesn't exist? 

YOUR ANSWER HERE

3. What does `setwd("..")` do? Are there any circumstances where this command fails? Try a few paths with ".." as one of the folders (not just on its own). What is `..`? What is `../..`? How about `.`?

YOUR ANS....oh you know what to do.

4. There is a folder called `plainText`. With `TextAnalysisWithR` as your working directory, change to this directory with: (a) one use of `setwd`; (b) two successive uses of `setwd`; (c) a single use of `setwd` but with a different path specification from in (a). To check your results, use `getwd()`.

# Assignment

1. Consider:

```{r eval=F}
x <- 10
print(x * 2)
x <- 2 * x
print(x)
```

Why doesn't the last line print `10`?

2. Computers are famed for their rigidity. Tell them to follow a set of instructions over and over again, and they will do the *same exact thing* over and over again. Write two lines that do not produce the same result when you enter them into the console repeatedly. Use `x`.

```{r}
# enter your R code, repeated several times, here
# enter your R code, repeated several times, here
```

Speculate: Is the same thing possible without using `x`?

3. Explain the difference between the following statements (try them both):

```{r eval=F}
five <- 2 + 2
5 <- 2 + 2
```

# Types

Write down variable names and types needed to store the following information. Remember that R variables are always vectors. Note when a multiple-element vector will be needed; just make up fake data.

For example: to store the information about whether the most recent winner of the Booker Prize is a U.K. citizen, one needs a single-element *logical* vector, so note this as follows:

```{r}
last_booker_uk <- F # logical
```
   
On the other hand, to store the information about whether *each* of the Booker winners were from what Paul Gilroy calls "Brit-town," we would need a multiple vector:

```{r}
booker_uk <- c(T, T, F) # and so on. logical: one element for each year
```

1.  the titles of all the novels written by Georgette Heyer

2.  the complete text of *Moby-Dick* (how many elements?)

3.  the complete text of *Moby-Dick*, with formatting information

4.  the gender of all the Nobel laureates in literature

5.  the number of copies of *Beloved* held in each library in New Jersey

6.  the total sales of *The Lord of the Rings* in each year since publication

7.  the dates of publication of each serial installment of *Great Expectations*

8.  the titles of Shakespeare's plays and their genres in the First Folio

9.  the names of 8 modernist poets and the number of times each one appeared in the same issue of *Poetry* as each of the others

10. *bonus:* the image currently appearing on your monitor
