# Thinking about strings

1. Try the funny-looking assignment `z <- c()`. Concatenate `z` with some other numeric vectors and explain what `z` is.

YOUR DESCRIPTIVE ANSWER HERE

2. Now consider `Z <- ""`. Imagine that `s` is a character vector but you don't know anything about it. What is the value of `str_c(Z, s)`? How about `str_c(s, Z)`? Try a few example values of your own for `s`.

```{r eval=F}
# this code is not executed, so you can write abstract identities
str_c(Z, s) <-      # fill in the blank
str_c(s, Z) <-      # fill in the blank
```

Explain in words the difference between this and `paste(s, Z)`. 

3. *Optional.* Specify another R value and another R function that has the same properties as the pairs (`z`, `c`) and (`Z`, `str_c`).

OPTIONAL ANSWER HERE

4. What is the default value of the `sep` parameter to `str_c`? Demonstrate your answer with an example:

```{r}
x <- "Let us go then"
y <- "you and I"
DEFAULT <- "?????" # CHANGE THIS
str_c(x, y)
str_c(x, y, sep=DEFAULT) # value should be same as previous
```

(*Bonus.* What could the default value for `collapse` possibly be?)


5. What is the default value of `sep` for `paste`?

EXPLAIN HERE

# Jockers's "first foray"

1. Copy the `TextAnalysisWithR/data/plainText/melville.txt` file to the same directory as your homework `.Rmd` file. Then you can replace the longer path with a simple mention of `melville.txt`.

2. Copy into the following code block the code for loading the text of the Gutenberg *Moby-Dick* from Jockers:

```{r}
# INSERT HERE: code to read the text into a new variable
text.v <- "fix me"
```

3. EXPLAIN HERE

4. Expression using `match`:

5. Single expression to strip paratexts:

6. Go ahead and do the practice problem. 

```{r, fig.cap=""}
# INSERT: fill in some code from Jockers here

# then:
top_word_counts <- 1:100    # REPLACE THIS with an expression for the
                            # frequencies of the top 100 words in Moby-Dick
plot(top_word_counts)
```

7. Download the plain text of [*The Sheik*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7031/pg7031.txt) from Project Gutenberg. Use "Save as" in your browser and put the file in the same directory as this homework, and give it the name `sheik-gutenberg.txt`. 

8. Load it into a character vector in R. Rather than use `scan`, use the simpler function `readLines`:

```{r}
# uncomment the next line when you have downloaded the file to the right place
# sheik_lines <- readLines("sheik-gutenberg.txt")
```

9. Following Jockers's pattern, remove the metadata, tokenize the text, and determine the number of times the words `sheik`, `body`, `love`, and `the` occur in this novel, ignoring case, and the total number of words in the novel. Assign these as named elements of a vector `sheik_counts`.

Let's stipulate that the text starts *after* the title page, with the word "CHAPTER," and ends before "THE END." Insert your code here:

```{r}
# fill in operations on sheik_lines...



sheik_counts <- numeric()


# fill in assignments to sheik_counts
sheik_counts["sheik"] <- 0
sheik_counts["body"] <- 0
# etc.

# and sheik_total
sheik_total <- 0
```


10. Compare the most frequent words in *The Sheik* to those in *Moby-Dick*. Make a few remarks on whether the 20 most frequent words distinguish these texts.

```{r}
# your code here
```

BRIEF DISCUSSION HERE


# A small challenge

1. It's often easier to work this kind of thing out with a toy example. 

```{r}
story <- "For sale: baby shoes, unworn."
story_words <- unlist(str_split(story, "\\W+"))
story_words <- story_words[story_words != ""]
```

```{r}
story_bigrams <- str_c()  # what goes here?
```

2. If your expression has any explicit vector constructions using `c()`, replace them with sequences using `:`.

```{r}
story_bigrams <- str_c()  # improved version here
```

3. If your expression has any literal numbers other than 1 in it, replace those with expressions using `length(story_words)`.

```{r}
story_bigrams <- str_c()  # even more improved here
```

4. Now construct the vector of all the bigrams in *The Sheik*.

```{r}
sheik_bigrams <- str_c() # what goes here?
```

5. Compute the word frequency table and sort it, and use it to list the top ten bigrams in the novel.

```{r}
# your code for constructing the bigrams table and listing the top 10
```
