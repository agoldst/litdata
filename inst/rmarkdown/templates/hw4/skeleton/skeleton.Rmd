# Lists: Exercise

The following lines, which use `str_detect`, a function we haven't yet studied, derive a character vector with one element for each chapter of *The Sheik*.

```{r}
# strip off all but the body text
body_ll <- sheik_ll[match("CHAPTER I", sheik_ll):
                    (match("THE END", sheik_ll) - 1)]
# find chapter heading indices:
# str_detect gives a logical vector telling us which lines
# match the pattern; which tells us the indices
chap_indices <- which(str_detect(body_ll, "^CHAPTER [IVX]"))

body_lc <- tolower(body_ll)

# initialize results vector
sheik_chaps <- character(length(chap_indices))

# tricky edge condition: contrive the last "chapter start"
# to be one past the last line
chap_indices <- c(chap_indices, length(body_ll) + 1)

for (j in seq_along(chap_indices[-length(chap_indices)])) {
    sheik_chaps[j] <- str_c(body_lc[chap_indices[j]:
                                   (chap_indices[j + 1] - 1)],
                           collapse=" ")
}
```

Now we split this up using our friend `str_split`:

```{r}
sheik_chaps_words <- str_split(sheik_chaps, "\\W+")
```

`sheik_chaps_words` is a *list*.

Now write a `for` loop that counts the *fraction* of times "Arab" and "Diana" occur in each chapter, storing the results in two vectors.

```{r}
arab <- numeric()
diana <- numeric()

# your for loop here

```

These lines will print out your results as occurrences per 10000 words:

For `arab`:

```{r eval=F}
round(arab * 10000)
```

For `diana`:

```{r eval=F}
round(diana * 10000)
```

# Data Frames: Exercises

## The logic of the query

Write down expressions that yield the following information by subscripting `laureates`.

1. What is the surname of the unique laureate born in Portugal?

```{r}
# your expression here
```

2. What are the first names and surnames of the female laureates? (A single expression, yielding two columns of information.)

```{r}
# your expression here
```

3. What are the full names of all the laureates who are either women *or* born in Sweden? 

```{r}
# your expression here
```

4. How many laureates died in a country other than the country of their birth? Derive also an expression for their names, countries of birth, and countries of death.

```{r}
# your expression here
```


## Sorting

1. Explain the relationship between a vector `x` and its ordering permutation `order(x)`.

YOUR EXPLANATION HERE

2. Now we are going to exploit our special data-frame subscripting syntax. So we don't go crazy, let's work on a smaller table:

```{r}
laur_small <- laureates[1:5, c("surname", "bornCountry", "gender", "year")]
```

Write an expression to sort this table alphabetically by surname.

```{r}
# your expression for sorting laur_small here
```

3. Now sort it in reverse alphabetical order by country of birth. 

```{r}
# your expression for sorting laur_small here
```

3. Sort `laur_small` by gender and year of prize. You'll need two `$` expressions.

```{r}
# your expression for sorting laur_small here
```

4. Write an expression in terms of `laureates` to show first names, surnames, birth dates, and prize years of the five most recently-born laureates. 

```{r}
# your expression here
```
